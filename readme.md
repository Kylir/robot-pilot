# Robot-Pilot

This is a NodeJS project to drive a small robot.

Here are the parts:

+ A Zumo chassis with
    + two micro motors and
    + four AA batteries
+ A Raspberry Pi Zero W 1.1
+ A motor driver TB6612
+ A ZeroLipo PHat and a LiPo battery to power the Pi and the motor driver

The application will use the NodeJS module [`pigpio`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pigpio).

First goal is to make the robot move!
